# BASED_Language

A custom programming language that has a Lexical, Syntax, and Semantic analyzer coded using Python

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: The initial phase of parsing a program or text. It involves breaking down the input into meaningful tokens like keywords, identifiers, and operators

- **Syntax Analysis**: Verifies whether the arrangement of tokens in the source code conforms to the syntax rules of the language

- **Semantic Analysis**: Meaning of the code is analyzed to ensure it follows the rules and conventions of the programming language, checking for logical errors and ensuring consistency in behavior.

- **Error Reporting**: Detects and communicates issues encountered during code compilation or execution to developers through descriptive messages

## Usage

Write the code in a text file called `input.txt`, and simply run `main.py`, and that's it!

*BASED_Language was built to fulfill the requirements of our Programming Languages course (CS0035) at FEU Alabang. The project was submitted during the 3rd semester of A.Y. 2021-2022.*
